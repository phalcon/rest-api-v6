# Contributing to Phalcon

Phalcon is an open source project and a volunteer effort. Phalcon welcomes contribution from everyone. Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Contributions

Contributions to Phalcon should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to merge patches). Feedback can be provided and potentially changes requested or the pull request will be merged. All contributions should
follow this format, even those from core contributors.

## Questions & Support

We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and have limited bandwidth to address all of them. Thus we only accept bug reports, new feature requests and pull requests in GitHub. Our great community and contributors are happy to help you though! Please use these community resources for obtaining help.

## Bug Report Checklist

* Make sure you are using the latest released version of the composer packages.

* Be sure that information such as OS, Phalcon version and PHP version are part of the bug report

## Pull Request Checklist

* Don't submit your pull requests to the `master` branch. Branch from the required branch and, if needed, rebase to the proper branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes
* Don't put submodule updates in your pull request unless they are to landed commits
* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature. Test classes should follow the [PSR-12 coding style guide](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-coding-style-guide.md).
